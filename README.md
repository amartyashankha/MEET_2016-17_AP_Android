Android App Development Advanced project guide for MEET 2016-2017

We will be following the Udacity course at <https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851>. Go ahead and create an account on Udacity and check out the material.

Clone Repo

Nerd Ranch Guide. Install epub reader.

##Installing Android SDK

Begin by downloading [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). and then follow the installation instructions in <https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html> to install the SDK.

*Note:* You will need to install some packages first. On Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386` in the terminal.

##Getting Started

The first few lectures (under first lesson `Create Project Sunshine`) in the course are just basic overview and an introduction to Git. Feel free to skip ahead to *Creating our First project*. You should go through the material up to lecture 9 *Running your Code*.

    Objective: By the end of this section, you should have a simple app running on your emulator.

##Views and Layouts

Exercise Update layout : Either through Design or Text
Start watching the following lectures

* [*Lecture 12*](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851/lessons/93affc67-3f0b-4f9b-b3a4-a7a26f241a86/concepts/200e9ec2-a5ec-4e4b-b0d9-bdc0a02d705f#) -- Activities, Packages, and Layouts
* [*Lecture 14*](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851/lessons/93affc67-3f0b-4f9b-b3a4-a7a26f241a86/concepts/cdbfd437-de24-4903-8f01-37c29427cb38#) -- Android Layouts Primer
* [*Lecture 19*](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851/lessons/93affc67-3f0b-4f9b-b3a4-a7a26f241a86/concepts/43e77b25-5212-4a18-99c4-51f20d4e27e0#) -- Visual Layout Editor

Now you should be able to complete the five Exercises in this section. The final two (`Update Sunshine layout` and `Add Scrolling Weather`) are the more important ones. Make sure to test your apps on the emulator.

Exercise Scrolling Weather : Use dummy list of data. Get reference to the *TextView* in *onCreate*. Loop through data, and add each entry to text view with blank lines in between. After the final exercise, you should be able to scroll through a list of your dummy data.

    Objective: By the end of this section, you should be able to manipulate the basic View elements and create custom Layouts.
