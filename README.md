Android App Development Advanced project guide for MEET 2016-2017

We will be following the Udacity course at <https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851>. Go ahead and create an account on Udacity and check out the material.

##Installing Android SDK

Begin by downloading Android Studio from <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>. and then follow the installation instructions in <https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html> to install the SDK.

*Note:* You will need to install some packages first. On Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386` in the terminal.

##Getting Started

The first few lectures (under first lesson `Create Project Sunshine`) in the course are just basic overview and an introduction to Git. Feel free to skip ahead to *Creating our First project*. You should go through the material up to lecture 9 *Running your Code*.

    Objective: By the end of this section, you should have a simple app running on your emulator.
